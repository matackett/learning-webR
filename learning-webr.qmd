# Introduction

Welcome!

## Set up

We have already loaded the R packages you need for this tutorial. Once you start working in RStudio, you will run code like the code shown below to load the R packages you need.

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(nycflights13)
```

```{webr-r}
#| context: setup

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(nycflights13)
```

# Exercises

All exercises are from [R for Data Science 2nd Edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

## Visualization 

### [Ex 5 in Section 1.5.5](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html#exercises-2)

```{webr-r}

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm,
                            color = species)) + 
  geom_point() 
```

## [Ex 1 in Section 1.4.3](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html#exercises-1)

Fill in the blank to make a barplot of `species`, such that `species` is assigned to the y aesthetic.

```{webr-r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(y = _____)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

## Data wrangling

### [Ex 3 in Section 3.5.7](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform.html#exercises-2)

```{webr-r}

flights |>
  group_by(dep_time) |> 
  summarize(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = dep_time, y = mean_delay)) + 
  geom_point()
```
